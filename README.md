This application utilizes flask to create a back end web  server.
This application uses react.js.
React is a javascript library that, transforms,
jsx in javascript/html.
React’s only concern is with the user interface (the ‘V’ in MVC), 
which is defined by a hierarchy of modular view Components that couple 
static markup with dynamic JavaScript. 

It relies on javascripts and the DOM model.
Using babel we can define almost pure html within javascript

Babel converts the elements in the React.CreatElement()

React converts JSX in Javascript

React Elements are created and used to control the DOM
elements are what you want to see on the screen
elements are what components are made of 
elements are immutable and represent the UI at a certain time

Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. 
They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements 
describing what should appear on the screen.

The application is structured using MVC.
Model View Component. 


CRUD is an acronym for the four basic types of SQL commands: Create , Read , Update , Delete . Most applications have some kind of CRUD functionality, and we can assume that every programmer had to deal with CRUD at some point. A CRUD application is one that uses forms to get data into and out of a database.

In the next section we will create a Seam Web application, connect it to the HSQL database and add CRUD support.
